This repo has wxWidget projects in various stages. All
are created while learning how to use wxGlade (GUI builder)
to make wxWidget based GUI applications using wxPerl to
implement the event handlers. Some examples have just the
final Perl script while others have the project file (and
potentially the Perl script).
